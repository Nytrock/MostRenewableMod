Annoyed that you can't get a bunch of cool items on skyblock map? Tired of running all over the world searching for your favorite painting or statue? Sick of changing your system date just to unlock seasonal content? Then this mod is for you!

**The Most Renewable Mod** is a mod that makes absolutely every item in Terraria renewable. For reference: a renewable item is one that can theoretically be obtained in infinite quantities within a single world. The mod adds tons of new, original ways to acquire items and even more!

---
Major Additions:
- 4 new fishing crates types: Forest, Mushroom, Golem, and Underground. Careful with the last one because it can explode!
- Biome Key now shimmer into their awakened versions. Place one such key in an empty chest and face a new enemy: the Biome Mimic Chest!
- New enemy in Ice Caves: Slush Merman. Fires slush at the player
- Configs for enabling Christmas and Halloween
- 2 new secret seeds: skyblock and parkour civilization. The first creates a replica of the [most renewable skyblock](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3474881954). The second is a mix of skyblock and getfixedboi seeds
- Painting Bags drop from some crates, granting random paintings from specific biomes
- Golem now drops Lihzahrd Bricks, and the Dungeon Crate drops Dungeon Bricks
- The Frost Legion is no longer Christmas-exclusive. Its summoning item can now be crafted
- Ice Grenade freezes nearby water. Also, Ice Slimes now drop Ice Blocks
- Bewiched Living Wood Wall, which allows to create artificial gnome farms

---
Other Changes:
- Loot changes to most fishing crates
- The Sandgun can now use Ash Blocks as ammo
- Dirt Bombs have a tiny chance to spawn the Dirtiest Block instead of the regular one
- The Carrot from the Collector's Edition is now available in regular game and can randomly grow on grass
- Mechdusa can now be summoned in any world
- The Cultist's Mysterious Tablet might drop Moon Lord Legs when broken (somebody is just bad at summoning eldritch horrors, huh?)
- Glowing Tulip can randomly grow in caves near the edge of the world
- Solutions are now sold in dontdigup and getfixedboi worlds
- Statues now craftable, but enemies spawned using them are not counted in the overall kill tally and don't drop banners (toggable)
- Bunch of lame crafting recipes, transmutations, NPC shops changes and mob drops added
